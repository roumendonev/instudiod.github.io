                            <strong>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) </strong> is a green building rating system developed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC).
                            It is the world’s most widely used green building program and sustainable building certification. Thus, ensuring your business adheres to the LEED certification requirements

                            <strong> Better for business </strong> - LEED buildings have a higher resale value and lower operational costs than non-LEED buildings. LEED is an essential strategy for achieving Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), decarbonization, and equity goals.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong> Better for people </strong> - LEED-certified buildings focus on occupant well-being, offering a healthier and more satisfying indoor space while addressing community and public health.

                            <strong> Better for the environment </strong> - LEED buildings use less energy and water, utilize renewable energy and fewer resources, create less waste, and preserve land and habitat.
