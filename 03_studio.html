                        The architecture of InStudioD is based on pursuit of quality. We believe that the surrounding
                        area which architects and designers create, have a great influence on our lives. That includes the home,
                        the work place and the public areas in between. Our well-being is affected not only by the buildings,
                        but also with the urban spaces and areas. In our work we are influenced by the needs of people
                        and the individual context of each project, the different characteristic of the climate,
                        situation and culture. We have applied these features to residential and public buildings in our work.
                        <br><br>
                        We accept the architecture as a synthesis of different elements that form the building:
                        the structural elements, the service and communication areas, the presence of natural light,
                        the relationship with the surrounding landscape, the ecological aspects of the design.
                        Our work is committed to our clients, and also to the public area and many people that use it.
                        Our relationship with the clients is based on a very high level of personal commitment, with great
                        respect for the preciousness of time and resources involved. In our work we find equally important
                        both the design and its successful execution.

                        Our belief is that the essential values of  the interior design and architecture are not different:
                        the creation of space and deployment of light, the careful designation of colours, materials and details.
                        But even the smallest elements in a building, like door handles or the ashtrays on the living room tables
                        are essential for our surrounding area. Some of these utility objects are often taken for granted, but
                        it is these smallest elements with which building's users have direct contact. All these parts of the
                        inside environment must be functional, but they should be pleasing to use - possessing good ergonomic,
                        aesthetic and tactile qualities and also placed in a convenient space. Our approach to the interior design,
                        pays attention to every little detail which forms the homes, or public interior spaces we design.
